## Overview

Chrome Text Highlighter is a Chrome extension that lets you highlight selected text and store the highlight locally so it can be restored when you revisit the page.


## Goal 

- Easily highlight text on webpages.
- Save highlights per page using the page’s URL.
- Automatically restore highlights on page load.

## Features 

- **Text Selection & Highlighting**: Use Option+3 to wrap selected text in a `<span>` with a yellow background.
- **Local Storage**: Saves the parent container's HTML snapshot along with a unique XPath.
- **Highlight Restoration**:
  Restores the saved container HTML only on the matching page.

## Architecture

- **Content Script (content.js):**

  - Detects text selection and applies highlight.
  - Chooses the direct parent of the highlight `<span>` as the container.
  - Generates a unique XPath using the element’s tag name and sibling order.
  - Uses the current page’s URL (e.g., `location.pathname`) as the storage key to isolate data.
- **Storage:**
  Uses `chrome.storage.local` to save and retrieve highlight data.

## Installation & Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. In Chrome, go to `chrome://extensions/`, enable Developer Mode, and click "Load unpacked" to select the project folder.
3. On a static webpage, highlight text by dragging and then press Option+3.

## Algorithm Overview

- **Highlight & Save:** Wrap the selected text in a `<span>` (yellow background), then save the parent container's HTML and its unique XPath.XPath is generated by traversing from the element up to the root using tag names and sibling order, ensuring a unique identifier. (tree traversal)
- **Restore:**
  On page load, retrieve saved data using the page’s URL as the key and replace the container’s HTML using the XPath.
